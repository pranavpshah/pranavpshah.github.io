This project was done as part of a Robotics Competition called, <a href="https://www.sick.com/us/en/tim10k/w/tim10k/"> SICK LiDaR $10K Challenge 2023</a>. We worked on creating an autonomous solution for the cleaning of garbage from open spaces such as parks, beaches, etc. 

#### We secured the First Place in this Competition.

The final submission included a project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eBHcfdx-CNmmY9gcT3kwR6UoZ3bD_4Wa/view?usp=sharing">Report</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JcPts7voj8">Video</a>.

We were featured in the following articles:
1. University of Pennsylvania GRASP Lab newsletter: UPenn released an article covering the journey of all the UPenn teams participating in the competition and solution presented by each team. Here is a <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/news/robotics-masters-students-take-on-sicks-tim10k-challenge">link</a>.
2. InDro Robotics Article: We have used a mobile base supplied by InDro Robotics as part of the proof-of-concept of our idea of an autonomous cleaning solution. The InDro team also interviewed us regarding our approach and any challenges we might have faced during the project. Here is a <a href="https://indrorobotics.ca/upenn-robotics-team-cleans-up-at-sick-lidar-competition/">link</a> to the article.
3. SICK article: The company that organized the competition, SICK, also came out with an article about the top 3 teams of this competition. Here is the <a href="https://sickusablog.com/university-students-use-sick-lidar-solve-real-world-problems/?utm_campaign=Oktopost-USA+-+TiM10K&utm_content=Oktopost-linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin">link</a> to the SICK article.

The cleaning industry is facing significant challenges due to its labor-intensive nature and the growing demand for services that exceed the capacity of many companies. Cleaning open spaces can be a time-consuming, monotonous task that might lead to long hours and loss of productivity for the company and its staff. To tackle this issue of monotonous task and loss of productivity and enable the staff to focus their efforts towards more intricate tasks, we have proposed an innovative autonomous solution that will efficiently and repetitively do the task of cleaning large open spaces, reliably.

We worked around the clock talking to experts from the cleaning industry, experts on robotics, and our peers to incorporate novel and challenging features into our product. We were successful in making a working prototype and have exciting plans lined up for the future. Our product is equipped with a multitude of sensors, enabling us to analyze patterns of waste accumulation and identify their locations. This information can assist authorities in placing dustbins in appropriate locations, thereby combating littering. Segregation after collection is a time-consuming and laborious task that we plan to streamline by segregating during collection. We also intend to develop an intuitive graphical user interface that will facilitate the selection of initial geofencing locations, display waste collection statistics, and generate heat maps highlighting areas of high litter density. Our coverage algorithm can then adapt the path based on litter density, allowing for a fast and efficient cleaning process. While our prototype is currently optimized for use in park settings, our vision is to develop add-ons tailored to various terrains and harsh climates. The future of SauberBOT appears “clean” and the entire team is excited to take this forward.
