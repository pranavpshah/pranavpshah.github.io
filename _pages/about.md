I am a professional with experience in various engineering fields like Electronics, Data Science, Mechanical and Robotics. My bid to continually learn from my experiences and explore unchartered territories has been my driving force since day one. 

I love the amalgamation of different fields and the field of Robotics provides just the right balance for this. It is this passion and my driving force that has encouraged me to pick up a diverse range of projects, courses and delve deeper in robotic research. I am not only interested in the question "How to make this?", but I am also interested in the questions "Why?", "How?" and most importantly "What can be done better?".

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
